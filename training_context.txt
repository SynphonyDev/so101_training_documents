Research Summary: LeRobot SO-101 & Training SmolVLA
Based on my research, here's what you need to know about training SmolVLA with your Hugging Face dataset:
LeRobot SO-101 Overview

The SO-101 is Hugging Face's 3D-printable robotic arm that costs around $100-500 depending on assembly and supplier, featuring improved motors that reduce friction and allow the arm to sustain its own weight TechEBlogTechCrunch
It's designed specifically for data collection through teleoperation, with a leader arm controlling the follower arm to create high-quality datasets Autodiscovery
Works with LeRobot's dataset format which automatically downloads from Hugging Face Hub GitHub

SmolVLA Key Details

SmolVLA is a compact 450M parameter Vision-Language-Action model trained exclusively on LeRobot Community Datasets from Hugging Face Hub Hugging Face
Small enough to run on a single consumer GPU or even a MacBook, making it highly accessible TechCrunch
Pretrained on community datasets, SmolVLA achieved a 26.6% absolute improvement over non-pretrained versions Hugging Face

Training SmolVLA with Your Dataset
Prerequisites:
bash# Install LeRobot
pip install -e ".[smolvla]"

# Login to Hugging Face
huggingface-cli login --token ${HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN}
Dataset Requirements:
You should record approximately 50 episodes as a starting point, with enough demonstrations per variation (e.g., if doing pick-place, record 10 episodes per cube position across 5 positions) Hugging Face
Training Command:
bashcd lerobot && lerobot-train \
  --policy.path=lerobot/smolvla_base \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/your-dataset \
  --batch_size=64 \
  --steps=20000 \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/my_smolvla \
  --job_name=my_smolvla_training \
  --policy.device=cuda \
  --wandb.enable=true
Training Details:

Training for 20k steps takes roughly 4 hours on a single A100 GPU Hugging Face
Start with a small batch size and increase incrementally if GPU allows Hugging FaceHugging Face
You can adjust steps based on your use case and performance

Dataset Format & Recording
Your dataset should be in LeRobotDataset format. If you need to record one:
bashpython -m lerobot.record \
  --robot.type=so101_follower \
  --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
  --robot.id=my_follower_arm \
  --robot.cameras="{ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}}" \
  --teleop.type=so101_leader \
  --teleop.port=/dev/ttyACM1 \
  --teleop.id=my_leader_arm \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/your-dataset \
  --dataset.num_episodes=50 \
  --dataset.single_task="Your task description"
After Training
Upload your model:
bashhuggingface-cli upload ${HF_USER}/my_smolvla_model \
  outputs/train/my_smolvla/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model
Run inference:
bashlerobot-record \
  --robot.type=so101_follower \
  --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
  --robot.id=my_follower_arm \
  --robot.cameras="{ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}}" \
  --dataset.single_task="Your task description" \
  --policy.path=${HF_USER}/my_smolvla_model
Important Notes

Data Quality is Key: A dataset with 25 episodes was insufficient and led to bad performance, while 50 episodes with proper variation structure (10 per position across 5 positions) worked well Hugging Face
Your dataset needs to be tagged as LeRobot format on Hugging Face for compatibility
If you have compute constraints, Synphony's neural world models could potentially help generate synthetic variations of your training data to augment your dataset!

Would you like me to help with any specific aspect of this, such as setting up your dataset format, optimizing training parameters for your compute setup, or exploring how Synphony's technology could augment your training data?
