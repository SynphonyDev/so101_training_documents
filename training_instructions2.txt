  🎯 What You Need to Know

  Dataset Clarification:
  - Your dataset actually has 2 cameras (side + wrist.left), not 1
  - This is GOOD for SmolVLA - more visual information!

  Training Plan:
  - Time: ~2-3 hours (H100 is fast)
  - Checkpoints: 4 checkpoints (at 5k, 10k, 15k, 20k steps)
  - No WandB: Simple, no external dependencies
  - Conservative settings: batch_size=64 to minimize errors
