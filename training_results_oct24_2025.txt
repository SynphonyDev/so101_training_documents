HUGGINGFACE UPLOAD
==================

Repository: synphony/smolvla-so101-demo
Status: ✓ UPLOADED
URL: https://huggingface.co/synphony/smolvla-so101-demo

Uploaded Contents: Complete checkpoint from /root/so101/outputs/train/so101_demo/checkpoints/last/
- Includes pretrained_model/ directory with all model weights
- Includes training_state/ directory with optimizer state

NOTES & OBSERVATIONS
====================

1. Training Duration:
   - Expected: 3-3.5 hours
   - Actual: 8+ hours
   - Reason: Training continued past 20K steps, reached 72+ epochs

2. Process Behavior:
   - Training completed all 20,000 steps successfully
   - Process did not exit cleanly after completion
   - Hung in post-training phase (likely cleanup or upload attempt)
   - Required manual termination (kill signal)

3. Common Warnings Observed:
   - "huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked..."
   - These warnings are normal and don't affect training
   - Can be suppressed with: export TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false

4. Training Logs:
   - Saved to: /root/so101/training.log (if using updated instructions)
   - Visible in tmux session during training

TRAINING PERFORMANCE
====================

Loss progression showed good convergence:
- Step 400: loss ~0.045
- Step 19K: loss ~0.007
- Step 20K: loss ~0.006 (FINAL)

The model achieved stable low loss, indicating successful training.

NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Verify model upload to HuggingFace (if desired)
2. Test inference with trained model
3. Deploy to SO-101 robot for evaluation
4. Consider fine-tuning if needed based on robot performance

MODEL LOADING
=============

✓ Model loads successfully from local path:
  from lerobot.policies.smolvla.modeling_smolvla import SmolVLAPolicy
  policy = SmolVLAPolicy.from_pretrained('outputs/train/so101_demo/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model')

✓ Model also available from HuggingFace:
  policy = SmolVLAPolicy.from_pretrained('synphony/smolvla-so101-demo')

For inference, refer to lerobot evaluation/inference examples.
